# Caesar-Cipher
 Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. The mathematical formula used for encryption is e(x) = (x + k)(mod 26) where x is the character we are encrypting and k is the number of bits we are shifting the character by. The formula for decryption is e(x) = (x -k) (mod 26).
Caesar.py uses a simple string of alpahbets to get the index value of the character in plaintext.
whereas caesar2.py makes use of isupper()fun to directly get its value.
